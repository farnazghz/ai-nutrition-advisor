To make this face mask, gently whisk an egg white, and apply a thin layer to your face. Allow it to dry for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse your face with warm water to remove the face mask. To take this face mask to the next level, add egg yolk! Egg yolks contain vitamins A, D, E, K, B vitamins, and choline. They also add healing and regenerative benefits to the mask. Adding a teaspoon of organic plain yogurt to this face mask helps support the microbiome. It‚Äôs also beneficial to increase egg intake. Eggs are a superfood and the highest-quality protein you can consume. If you're going to fry your eggs, fry eggs in olive oil, butter, or coconut oil.
