It‚Äôs a grass-fed cheese made with high standards not seen in American Parmesan cheese-making. Grass-fed cheese is loaded with microbes that come from the soil. Cows need the help of microbes to digest the fiber in the grass they consume. These microbes produce byproducts from the grass that help nourish the cow. The process of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese-making also involves microbes! Parmigiano Reggiano is made from 3 ingredients: high-quality cow‚Äôs milk, salt, and an enzyme that turns the milk into cheese. U.S. Parmesan cheese also contains potassium sorbate. Parmigiano Reggiano is a raw product without fillers or preservatives that's aged at least 12 months. There are no aging requirements for Parmesan cheese. Some Parmigiano Reggiano is aged for 14 to 24 months, or longer. Microbes consume lactose during the aging process, so the finished product is often lactose-free. Parmigiano Reggiano has the following health benefits: ‚Ä¢High in glutamate ‚Ä¢Contains bioavailable calcium and phosphorus ‚Ä¢Helps build glutathione, a potent antioxidant that supports liver health ‚Ä¢Reduces blood pressure ‚Ä¢Contains butyric acid, which supports brain health Parmigiano Reggiano has the highest amount of vitamin K2 compared to all other cheeses. Vitamin K2 redirects calcium in the arteries and joints to the teeth and bones. Parmigiano Reggiano contains MK-7, the most bioavailable form of vitamin K2.
