Don't be. Learn more here: https://drbrg.co/4k5qz2P The average commodity bacon at the grocery store is affordable, but is the more costly bacon worth it? Once a pig is weaned from its mother, it‚Äôs sent to a feedlot, weighing about 40 to 50 pounds. It will then live in a 7-square-foot area where it will be fattened to over 250 pounds in 3 to 4 months! Commercial pigs are fed GMO corn and soy. They‚Äôre also given drugs in the US, like ractopamine, to quickly increase muscle growth before slaughter. This drug is banned in 90 countries! Laws protect the privacy of these farms, so it‚Äôs difficult for the public to discover what truly occurs there. When bacon is processed, artificial smoke flavoring, salt, sugar, water, and MSG are typically added. This process is not generally used for high-quality bacon. Nitrates are chemicals that act as antibacterials and flavor enhancers. When exposed to high heat, however, they can turn into carcinogens. Singing Pastures is an excellent source of pasture-raised bacon. Pigs are rotated in small pastures to allow grass to regenerate. In Spain and Italy, pigs are often fed acorns. Pork is also cured to enhance flavor and quality. Pork is one of the best sources of vitamin B1. Pasture-raised pork contains vitamin D and trace minerals such as selenium and zinc. Lard is a healthy fat and, if it comes from a properly raised pig, is a great addition to cooking and baking. Overcooked bacon can create carcinogenic byproducts. Avoid this by cooking your bacon in the oven or air fryer. To counteract carcinogens, cook your bacon with olive oil, garlic, and onion. Avoid microwavable bacon!
