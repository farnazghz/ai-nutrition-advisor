Many people describe feelings of euphoria and bliss after a 3-day fast. Fasting is often done for spiritual or mental benefits, and it‚Äôs the only way to achieve deep cleaning in the body. Extended fasting is also a great way to exercise willpower. One of the most significant risk factors for cancer is age, due to the cumulative damage to your cells. Cancer tends to grow into areas of inflammation and low oxygen, and fasting is one of the most potent ways to reduce inflammation. Cancer can not live on the ketones that come from fasting. Ketones support your brain and even activate genes that extend your life. Extended fasting may prevent cancer, so aim for a monthly 72-hour fast. Fasting significantly lowers insulin. Your body can not grow a tumor when insulin is low. To further reduce cancer risk, increase oxygen by going for long walks while fasting. Exercise significantly increases oxygen. Growth hormone also increases while you‚Äôre fasting, which helps you burn fat and preserve muscle. Apply the following fasting tips for the easiest transition and the most fasting benefits: ‚Ä¢Increase fat intake 1 to 2 days before fasting ‚Ä¢Practice intermittent fasting regularly before trying extended fasting ‚Ä¢Consume plenty of electrolytes ‚Ä¢Consume sea salt ‚Ä¢Don't break your fast with sweets or carbs ‚Ä¢Try fermented vegetables, eggs, or bone broth to break your fast ‚Ä¢Slowly wake up your digestive system after fasting If you‚Äôre prone to gallstones, you could experience increased bile sludge while fasting. TUDCA keeps bile thin and flowing properly through the ducts. Take 2 TUDCA twice daily. Don‚Äôt do extended fasting if you‚Äôre pregnant or lactating!
