Find out about the grass-fed scam and what you can do to make healthy choices. 0:00 Introduction: Grass-fed beef exposed 1:36 Grass fed vs. grain fed 2:52 Antibiotics and grass-fed beef 3:29 Feedlots in the U.S. 4:41 100% grass-fed beef Uncover deceptive food marketing tactics and boost your label IQ with this FREE resource: https://drbrg.co/4kPNksw Get clear definitions of common health and nutrition terms here: https://drbrg.co/4kpzb5v In 2016, the USDA dropped the official definition of grass-fed. Technically, all cows are grass-fed until the last 3 to 6 months of their lives, when they‚Äôre typically fattened with grains. However, despite misleading food labels, over 99% of beef in the store is not truly grass-fed. Cows are fed grains to quickly fatten them up, but these aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù grains like many people assume. Cows in feedlots are fed DDGS (dried distillers grain with solubles), a cheap waste product of GMO, inedible dent corn used for making ethanol. This is incredibly profitable because it causes the cows to gain weight quickly for very little cost. Fiber, limestone, and synthetic vitamins and minerals are added to this corn byproduct. Monensin, an antibiotic, is also added. Antibiotics are regularly used in feedlots in the U.S. to quickly increase weight gain in animals. Beta-agonists are also used to enhance muscle growth. Some studies have shown that the use of this medication in animals can cause anxiety in the humans who consume them. There are two types of feedlots: open and closed. In closed feedlots, the cows only get 24 square feet of space and around 150 square feet in open feedlots. For truly grass-fed beef, look for 100% grass-fed.
