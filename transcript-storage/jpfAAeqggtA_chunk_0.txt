Colostrum has potent antiviral, antitumor, and wound-healing properties. Colostrum milk acts as an immune system ‚Äúdownload‚Äù passed from mother to baby after birth. If you weren‚Äôt breastfed as an infant, don‚Äôt worry! You can still take colostrum. Colostrum is produced in the first 24 to 72 hours after birth. It‚Äôs golden in color and rich in essential probiotics, including L. reuteri. It‚Äôs significantly more immune-building than regular milk and even contains stem cells. Colostrum also contains an important prebiotic called HMO (human milk oligosaccharides) that feeds the probiotics found in breast milk. Colostrum contains cholesterol and omega-3 fats, vital for brain health, and important hormones like oxytocin and cortisol. Many infants are fed infant formula, which is essentially ultra-processed food calories. Most infant formulas are made of low-quality ingredients such as maltodextrin and soy, and they lack the immune benefits and probiotics of breast milk. Children who were fed infant formula are more predisposed to allergies, asthma, skin problems, obesity, cognitive delays, and other health problems. If you didn‚Äôt get colostrum as a baby, there are still many benefits of colostrum for adults. You can take colostrum in supplement form. Colostrum is beneficial for gut health and can help fix a leaky gut or gut damage. It can help lower inflammation, increase good microbes, and decrease pathogens. Colostrum has powerful benefits for respiratory problems such as allergies and asthma. It can also help an overactive immune system and many autoimmune conditions. Colostrum helps support the thymus glands as you age and is very beneficial for age-related problems such as muscle loss, wrinkles, macular degeneration, and arthritis. It can even help with long COVID, Hashimoto‚Äôs, autism, and Lyme disease. Colostrum is heat-sensitive, so look for a freeze-dried supplement!
