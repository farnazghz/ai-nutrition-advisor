A poorly functioning pancreas can result in bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Baking soda can work as a temporary solution for an acid stomach, but not for indigestion! Indigestion is caused by low stomach acid, so baking soda would only worsen the problem. Apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride can help with indigestion. GERD and acid reflux are also related to low stomach acid, but baking soda can help temporarily. ACV and betaine hydrochloride are better long-term solutions. Baking soda can also help with gastritis, but it should be taken with zinc carnosine for this problem. Stomach acid should be highly acidic with a pH between 1 and 3. Drinking baking soda for long periods can neutralize your stomach acid, inhibiting your ability to digest protein, absorb B12, and absorb minerals. Low stomach acid can also lower your ability to kill microbes and pathogens in your food. Baking soda neutralizes the acid in your mouth and is an excellent addition to toothpaste. It can also help relieve itching related to a kidney problem and enhance athletic performance! Baking soda consumption can help prevent kidney stones and can also be helpful if you have a UTI. Baking soda can be used topically for certain insect bites, especially for fire ant bites and bee stings. It can also be used as pest control for insects like cockroaches. Don't take baking soda with vinegar or lemon juice! This creates a significant amount of carbon dioxide, which can leave you feeling bloated.
